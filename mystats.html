<h3>My favourite food is Biriyani</h3>

<p>
I love biriyani for its irresistible blend of flavors and textures. The aromatic spices, 
tender meat or vegetables, and fragrant rice create a mouthwatering symphony for the senses. 
Biriyani offers a comforting and nostalgic experience, often tied to cultural traditions. 
Its versatility allows customization to suit individual tastes, making it a beloved and 
satisfying dish for many.
